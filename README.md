# Optimisation Units coding practice

A coding practice for the optimisation methods unit, testing different algorithms.

## Install Python and Jupyter notebook

1. To install Python, go to: https://www.python.org, download and install your prefered Python version (I personally suggest Python 3.8).
3. Install pip, go to: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

Or update pip

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

4. Install notebook, go to: https://jupyter.org/install 
5. Rememeber to do these commands in the terminal, for example

```bash
python -m pip install jupyter
 ```
6. Run locally. Once all installation steps above are completed, open a command line in the project directory.


```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Alternatively, try anaconda, see in here
